# Restaurant System
First year project in C, using linked list and files.

The program have 5 options:
1. Get the dishes names from "Manot.txt" file, every row in the file is a dish.
2. Adding a dish to the stock.
3. Order dishes.
4. Return a dish from a table.
5. Closing a table and get the bill.

The program work on files, there is "Instructions.txt" file that the program get the data from and "output.txt" file where all the output data goes.
Every line in "input.txt" start with the number of the option.
1. Option 1 must be the first option the program run so the first line in "Instructions.txt" in 1.
2. For adding a dish to the stock we write the number of option - 2, the name of the dish and the quantity.
3. For order a dish we write the number of option - 3, the number of table, the name of the dish and the quantity.
4. For returning a dish we write the number of option - 4, the number of table, the name of the dish and the quantity.
5. For closing a table and get the bill we wrtie the number of option - 5 and the number of table.

If the table we close is the last table, we also print to most ordered dish in that session.

The repository contain text files for example.
